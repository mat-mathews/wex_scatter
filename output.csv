The `Program` class in the consumer application instantiates and interacts with a `DataService` to retrieve and display `Person` objects, showcasing the interoperability between projects.  It also directly creates `Person` instances to illustrate working with the models independently."", ""MyDotNetApp.Consumer/Helpers/ReportGenerator.cs"": ""The `ReportGenerator.cs` file defines a `ReportGenerator` class within the `MyDotNetApp.Consumer.Helpers` namespace.  This class uses dependency injection to interact with a `IDataService` to generate reports, primarily a summary report of people,  and provides methods for data retrieval and formatting.  It leverages asynchronous operations for data fetching and uses a `StringBuilder` for efficient report construction.""}"
